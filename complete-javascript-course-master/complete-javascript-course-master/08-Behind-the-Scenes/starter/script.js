//notes will be on the code

//high level - the developer does not have to manage computer resources. limits optimization but less stressful
//garbage collected - cleans up the memory not in use automatically
//interpreted or just in time compiled- interprets human readable codde to machine code within the javascript engine itself.
//multi-paradigm - supports multiple programming approaches procedural vs object oriented
//prototyped based object oriented- almost everything in js is an object 
//first class functions- functions are treated as variables which means they can be passed within other functions.
//dynamic - data types are automatically assigned instead of explicitly defined for a variable
//single-threaded - javascript can only run one thing at a time
//non-blocking behavior- uses an event loop to run long running tasks in the background, suspends them when needed then moves them back to the front of the line when needed.
